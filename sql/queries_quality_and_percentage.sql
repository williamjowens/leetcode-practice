Table: Queries

| Column Name | Type    |

This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

    query_name VARCHAR(255),
